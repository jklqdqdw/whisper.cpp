[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   There is no problem in kicking off the sprint, but at the end of the sprint, how are we going to deal with the code that we wrote?
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.760]   Right. So I want to make sure that we are aligned on that.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.560]   We have a strategy for that, how we move forward with that code and then we can kick off the sprint.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.180]   That's what that's what I want to have this brains think about this one.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.660]   What environment they are going to put it, how are they going to use the branching, what branches they are going to merge it into?
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.000]   Because we know the strategy for our U.S.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.800]   But if we are saying that this is like any other feature development, the way we treat any other feature for development, we need to just use the same strategy.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800]   Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Why is it that? Why should we?
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.100]   Why should we be thinking something very distinct for this particular change as opposed to a business feature change?
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.400]   Right. It's another technical feature.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.160]   I think it's a very different approach to the way we do it.
